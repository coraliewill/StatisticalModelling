# Statistical Modelling

#### Practicals from statistical modelling class.

Linear regression models a continuous response Y given a continuous or categorical predictor variable x:

Y\_i = β0 + β1xi + ei
y_i $\sim N(x\_i^T $\beta, $\sigma^2)

Mathematical extensions of linear regression models allow to overcome assumptions of normality of the data, linearity relationships and variance structure in the model.

Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) are GLMs that allow the
