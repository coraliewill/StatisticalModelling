# Statistical Modelling

#### Practicals from statistical modelling class.

Linear regression models a continuous response Y given a continuous or categorical predictor variable x:

X<sub>i</sub>

\begin{equation}
Y_i = β0 + β1xi + ei 

y_i \sim N(x_i^T \beta, \sigma^2) 
\end{equation}

Mathematical extensions of linear regression models allow to overcome assumptions of normality of the data, linearity relationships and variance structure in the model.


## Generalized Linear Models (GLMs)

Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) are extensions of linear regression models that allow to model response with another error distribution model other than normal.

#### Collinearity

#### Temporal Autocorrelation

#### Nonlinearity on the link scale 



## Generalized Additive Models (GAMs)

Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) are GLMs that allow the relationship between response and predictor variables to be non-linear.

## Generalized Estimating Equations (GEEs)
